Title
Inflammatory Resilience Index (IRI) Combining hs-CRP, Albumin, and Grip Strength as a Predictor of Mortality: A Prospective NHANES Cohort Study

Design
Prospective cohort analysis leveraging NHANES examination data and linked mortality files.

Population
Inclusion: Adults ≥18 years with
• hs-CRP,
• serum albumin,
• grip strength,
• eligibility for mortality linkage.
Exclusion:
• pregnancy,
• hs-CRP >10 mg/L in primary analysis.

Exposure
Components:
• hs-CRP (log-transformed),
• serum albumin (g/dL),
• grip strength (kg; sex-standardized).
Construct the IRI by standardizing each component:
• hs-CRP z-score multiplied by −1 (higher = worse inflammation),
• albumin z-score (higher = better protein reserve/anti-inflammatory proxy),
• grip strength z-score (higher = better functional reserve).
IRI = (−z hs-CRP) + z albumin + z grip strength.
Higher IRI indicates greater resilience.

Analyze IRI as a continuous variable and in quartiles.

Outcomes
Primary: Cardiovascular mortality.
Secondary: Heart failure mortality, all-cause mortality.

Covariates
Demographics, socioeconomic factors, lifestyle variables, BMI, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, kidney function, and self-reported cardiovascular disease.

Statistical Plan
• Use appropriate NHANES survey weights, strata, and PSUs.
• Describe baseline characteristics by IRI quartiles.
• Fit Cox proportional hazards models with sequential adjustment:
	1.	age, sex, race/ethnicity,
	2.	socioeconomic and lifestyle factors,
	3.	clinical comorbidities.
• Compare IRI against hs-CRP alone to assess incremental prognostic value (change in C-statistics and likelihood ratio tests).
• Conduct prespecified subgroup analyses (age, sex, obesity, baseline CVD).
• Perform sensitivity analyses excluding early deaths and incorporating hs-CRP >10 mg/L.

Rationale and Novelty
Existing inflammatory markers predict risk but do not fully capture functional reserve. Grip strength and albumin each correlate with frailty, inflammation, and long-term prognosis. Combining hs-CRP with markers of physiologic reserve provides an integrated measure of systemic resilience. The IRI offers a simple, interpretable composite that may outperform hs-CRP alone in predicting mortality.

Expected Contribution
The IRI may serve as a clinically useful, low-cost prognostic tool. The study tests whether integrating inflammation and functional biomarkers offers improved discrimination over inflammation alone, using a large, nationally representative dataset with long follow-up.
