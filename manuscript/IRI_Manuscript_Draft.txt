ABSTRACT
================================================================================

BACKGROUND: Inflammation, nutritional status, and muscle mass independently 
predict adverse health outcomes. An integrated index combining these domains 
may better capture overall physiologic resilience than individual biomarkers.

OBJECTIVES: To develop an Inflammatory Resilience Index (IRI) combining 
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), serum albumin, and appendicular 
lean mass index (ALMI), and evaluate its association with functional outcomes 
in U.S. adults.

METHODS: Using NHANES 2015-2020 with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) 
data, we constructed the IRI as: (−z_hs-CRP) + z_Albumin + z_ALMI, where higher 
values indicate better resilience. Among 2,729 adults aged ≥20 years with 
complete data, we examined associations between IRI quartiles and functional 
outcomes (fair/poor self-rated health, difficulty walking ¼ mile, depression 
[PHQ-9 ≥10]) using survey-weighted logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, 
and race/ethnicity.

RESULTS: The IRI ranged from -5.2 to 5.2 (mean 0.74 ± 1.48). Participants in 
the lowest IRI quartile (Q1) were older (42.3 vs 34.3 years), more often female 
(68.6% vs 25.1%), had higher hs-CRP (4.08 vs 0.77 mg/L), lower albumin (4.12 vs 
4.70 g/dL), and lower ALMI z-scores (-0.40 vs 0.53) compared to Q4. The 
prevalence of fair/poor health decreased from 19.2% (Q1) to 9.2% (Q4), and 
difficulty walking from 12.4% to 2.5%. In adjusted models, each 1-unit IRI 
increase was associated with 19% lower odds of fair/poor health (OR: 0.81; 
95% CI: 0.74-0.89; p<0.001) and 22% lower odds of walking difficulty (OR: 0.78; 
95% CI: 0.67-0.91; p=0.005). Comparing Q1 to Q4, odds were 2.07-fold higher for 
fair/poor health (95% CI: 1.42-3.01; p=0.004) and 4.51-fold higher for walking 
difficulty (95% CI: 1.96-10.42; p=0.006).

CONCLUSIONS: A novel Inflammatory Resilience Index integrating inflammation, 
nutritional reserve, and muscle mass is significantly associated with 
self-rated health and mobility limitations in U.S. adults. Lower IRI identifies 
individuals with substantially higher odds of poor functional outcomes, 
supporting its potential utility as a composite marker of physiologic reserve.

HIGHLIGHTS
================================================================================

• The Inflammatory Resilience Index (IRI) combines hs-CRP, albumin, and 
  appendicular lean mass into a single composite measure

• Compared with the highest IRI quartile, the lowest quartile had ~2-fold 
  higher odds of fair/poor self-rated health and ~4.5-fold higher odds of 
  walking difficulty

• These associations persist after adjustment for age, sex, and race/ethnicity

• IRI captures integrated physiologic resilience across inflammation, 
  nutrition, and muscle mass domains

• This exploratory index warrants validation in prospective cohorts with 
  hard clinical endpoints

================================================================================
INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

Systemic inflammation, nutritional status, and skeletal muscle mass represent 
three interconnected physiologic domains that independently predict adverse 
health outcomes including mortality, cardiovascular disease, and functional 
decline (1-3). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a marker of 
low-grade systemic inflammation, is associated with increased cardiovascular 
risk even after adjustment for traditional risk factors (4). Serum albumin, 
reflecting both hepatic synthetic function and nutritional adequacy, predicts 
mortality across diverse populations (5). Appendicular lean mass, a measure of 
skeletal muscle, declines with aging and is a key component of sarcopenia and 
frailty syndromes (6).

While each biomarker provides prognostic information independently, the 
interplay between inflammation, nutrition, and muscle mass suggests that 
integrated assessment may better capture overall physiologic resilience. 
Chronic inflammation promotes catabolism and muscle wasting; malnutrition 
impairs immune function and muscle protein synthesis; and sarcopenia is 
associated with increased inflammatory markers (7-9). This bidirectional 
relationship creates a "vicious cycle" that accelerates functional decline 
in vulnerable individuals.

Previous composite indices have combined subsets of these domains. The Glasgow 
Prognostic Score uses CRP and albumin to predict cancer outcomes (10). Frailty 
indices incorporate measures of strength, nutrition, and functional status (11). 
However, a simple composite specifically integrating inflammation, nutrition, 
and objective muscle mass measurement has not been widely evaluated in 
population-based samples.

We hypothesized that an Inflammatory Resilience Index (IRI) combining hs-CRP, 
serum albumin, and appendicular lean mass index (ALMI) from dual-energy X-ray 
absorptiometry (DEXA) would identify individuals with poor self-rated health 
and functional limitations. Using nationally representative data from NHANES 
2015-2020, we aimed to: (1) construct the IRI as a simple additive z-score 
composite; (2) characterize the demographic and clinical profiles of adults 
across IRI quartiles; and (3) evaluate associations between IRI and functional 
outcomes including self-rated health, mobility limitations, and depressive 
symptoms.

We emphasize that the IRI is proposed as an exploratory composite index, not 
a validated clinical score. This analysis represents an initial step toward 
understanding whether integrated assessment of these three domains provides 
incremental information beyond individual biomarkers.

================================================================================
METHODS
================================================================================

DATA SOURCE AND STUDY POPULATION

This analysis used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative survey of the civilian, 
non-institutionalized U.S. population conducted by the National Center for 
Health Statistics (12). NHANES employs a complex, multistage probability 
sampling design with oversampling of certain subgroups to ensure reliable 
estimates. Participants undergo standardized interviews, physical examinations, 
and laboratory assessments.

We combined data from NHANES cycles 2015-2016 and 2017-2020 (pre-pandemic), 
which include DEXA body composition measurements. The analytic sample included 
adults aged ≥20 years with complete data for hs-CRP (≤10 mg/L, to exclude 
acute infection), serum albumin, and DEXA-derived appendicular lean mass. 
Participants with hs-CRP >10 mg/L were excluded to focus on chronic low-grade 
inflammation rather than acute infectious or inflammatory conditions (13).

The final eligible cohort included 2,729 participants with complete IRI 
components and functional outcome data.

INFLAMMATORY RESILIENCE INDEX CONSTRUCTION

The IRI was constructed as an additive composite of three standardized 
components:

    IRI = (−z_hs-CRP) + z_Albumin + z_ALMI

Where:
• z_hs-CRP = log-transformed hs-CRP, standardized within the analytic sample 
  and inverted so that lower inflammation yields higher scores
• z_Albumin = serum albumin standardized within the analytic sample
• z_ALMI = appendicular lean mass index standardized within sex (sex-specific 
  z-scores)

For hs-CRP and albumin, z-scores were calculated using the pooled sample mean 
and standard deviation. For ALMI, sex-specific standardization was used to 
account for known differences in muscle mass between men and women. Higher IRI 
values indicate better inflammatory resilience (lower inflammation, higher 
albumin, greater muscle mass). This formulation assigns equal weight to each 
domain and is designed for simplicity and interpretability. The composite IRI 
was not re-centered after construction; thus, the sample mean deviates slightly 
from zero due to eligibility restrictions and missing data patterns.

COMPONENT MEASUREMENTS

High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP): Measured in serum using latex-
enhanced nephelometry at a central laboratory. Values were reported in mg/L. 
Participants with hs-CRP >10 mg/L were excluded per American Heart Association 
guidelines for cardiovascular risk assessment (13).

Serum albumin: Measured using the bromocresol purple method in the standard 
NHANES biochemistry panel. Values were reported in g/dL.

Appendicular lean mass index (ALMI): Calculated from whole-body DEXA scans 
(Hologic Discovery model A). Appendicular lean mass was defined as the sum of 
lean soft tissue mass in the arms and legs, excluding bone mineral content. 
ALMI was calculated as appendicular lean mass (kg) divided by height squared 
(m²). For the IRI, ALMI was converted to sex-specific z-scores (standardized 
separately within men and women) to account for known sex differences in 
muscle mass while facilitating combination with other index components.

FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES

Primary outcomes were obtained from NHANES questionnaire data:

1. Self-rated health: Participants rated their general health as excellent, 
   very good, good, fair, or poor. We created a binary outcome for fair/poor 
   health versus excellent/very good/good.

2. Mobility limitation: Participants reported difficulty walking a quarter 
   mile. Those reporting "some difficulty," "much difficulty," or "unable to 
   do" were classified as having walking difficulty.

3. Depression: The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was administered. 
   A score ≥10 was used to identify moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms, 
   consistent with standard clinical cutoffs (14).

COVARIATES

Demographic variables included age (continuous), sex (male/female), and 
race/ethnicity (categorized as non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, 
Mexican American, other Hispanic, Asian, and other/multiracial). Additional 
covariates for sensitivity analyses included body mass index (BMI), diabetes 
(defined as HbA1c ≥6.5%, self-reported diabetes, or diabetes medication use), 
hypertension (average systolic BP ≥130 mmHg, diastolic BP ≥80 mmHg, or 
antihypertensive medication use), and current smoking status.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

All analyses incorporated NHANES survey weights, strata, and primary sampling 
units to account for the complex survey design. Examination weights were scaled 
for combined cycles per NCHS guidelines (15). Because DEXA is performed in a 
subsample of examined participants, estimates are nationally representative of 
U.S. adults eligible for and completing DEXA body composition assessment; older 
adults and those with mobility limitations may be underrepresented.

Baseline characteristics were compared across IRI quartiles using survey-
weighted means and proportions. P-values for trend were obtained from 
Wald tests in survey-adjusted regression models with IRI quartile as an 
ordinal predictor.

Associations between IRI and functional outcomes were evaluated using 
survey-weighted logistic regression. Three modeling approaches were used:
1. Continuous IRI: odds ratio per 1-unit increase in IRI
2. Quartile analysis: odds ratios for Q1, Q2, and Q3 compared to Q4 
   (highest resilience, reference)
3. Sensitivity analysis: fully adjusted models including BMI, diabetes, 
   hypertension, and smoking

Prevalence of each outcome by IRI quartile was calculated with survey-
weighted standard errors. A two-sided p-value <0.05 was considered 
statistically significant. Analyses were performed using R version 4.3 
with the survey package (16).

RESULTS
================================================================================

STUDY POPULATION

Of 25,531 NHANES 2015-2020 participants, 2,729 adults aged ≥20 years met 
eligibility criteria with complete IRI components (hs-CRP ≤10 mg/L, albumin, 
and DEXA-derived ALMI). The mean age was 39.6 ± 11.4 years, 48.6% were female, 
and the racial/ethnic distribution was 61.5% non-Hispanic White, 11.0% 
non-Hispanic Black, 8.4% Mexican American, 10.8% Asian, and 8.3% other.

The IRI ranged from -5.16 to 5.24, with a mean of 0.74 (SD 1.48). Quartile 
boundaries were: Q1 (≤-0.28, lowest resilience), Q2 (-0.28 to 0.83), Q3 
(0.83 to 1.90), and Q4 (>1.90, highest resilience).

CHARACTERISTICS BY IRI QUARTILE (TABLE 1)

Participants in the lowest IRI quartile (Q1) differed substantially from 
those in the highest quartile (Q4):

Demographics:
• Age: Q1 participants were older (42.3 vs 34.3 years, p<0.001)
• Sex: Q1 had more females (68.6% vs 25.1%, p<0.001)
• BMI: Higher in Q1 (29.5 vs 27.4 kg/m², p<0.001)

IRI Components:
• hs-CRP: 5.3-fold higher in Q1 (4.08 vs 0.77 mg/L, p<0.001)
• Albumin: Lower in Q1 (4.12 vs 4.70 g/dL, p<0.001)
• ALMI z-score: Lower in Q1 (-0.40 vs 0.53, p<0.001)

Comorbidities:
• Diabetes: More prevalent in Q1 (15.6% vs 5.7%, p<0.001)
• Hypertension: Similar across quartiles (~35-41%, p=0.20)
• CVD history: Numerically higher in Q1 (5.4% vs 2.3%, p=0.12)
• Current smoking: More prevalent in Q1 (25.8% vs 16.5%, p=0.03)

FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES BY IRI QUARTILE (TABLE 2)

Clear gradients in functional outcome prevalence were observed across IRI 
quartiles:

Fair/Poor Self-Rated Health:
• Q1 (lowest resilience): 19.2% (SE 2.0%)
• Q2: 17.5% (SE 1.6%)
• Q3: 13.8% (SE 1.9%)
• Q4 (highest resilience): 9.2% (SE 1.0%)
• Absolute difference Q1 vs Q4: 10.0 percentage points

Difficulty Walking ¼ Mile:
• Q1: 12.4% (SE 1.7%)
• Q2: 8.7% (SE 1.4%)
• Q3: 7.8% (SE 1.3%)
• Q4: 2.5% (SE 0.6%)
• Absolute difference Q1 vs Q4: 9.9 percentage points

Depression (PHQ-9 ≥10):
• Q1: 8.5% (SE 0.9%)
• Q2: 7.0% (SE 1.3%)
• Q3: 6.6% (SE 0.9%)
• Q4: 5.3% (SE 0.6%)
• Absolute difference Q1 vs Q4: 3.2 percentage points

MULTIVARIABLE ASSOCIATIONS (TABLE 2)

Continuous IRI Analysis:
Each 1-unit increase in IRI was associated with significantly lower odds of 
adverse functional outcomes after adjustment for age, sex, and race/ethnicity:
• Fair/poor health: OR 0.81 (95% CI: 0.74-0.89), p<0.001
• Walking difficulty: OR 0.78 (95% CI: 0.67-0.91), p=0.005
• Depression: OR 0.90 (95% CI: 0.77-1.05), p=0.14 (not significant)

Quartile Analysis (Q4 reference):
Compared to participants in the highest IRI quartile (Q4), those in the 
lowest quartile (Q1) had significantly elevated odds:
• Fair/poor health: OR 2.07 (95% CI: 1.42-3.01), p=0.004
• Walking difficulty: OR 4.51 (95% CI: 1.96-10.42), p=0.006
• Depression: OR 1.40 (95% CI: 0.79-2.49), p=0.19 (not significant)

The intermediate quartiles showed graded associations, with Q2 and Q3 
generally having odds ratios between Q1 and Q4, supporting a dose-response 
relationship.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSES

In fully adjusted models including BMI, diabetes, hypertension, and smoking, 
associations were modestly attenuated but remained significant for self-rated 
health (continuous IRI OR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.76-0.95, p=0.02). This attenuation 
is consistent with obesity and metabolic factors lying on a potential pathway 
between inflammatory resilience and functional outcomes.

================================================================================
DISCUSSION
================================================================================

In this nationally representative sample of U.S. adults, we developed and 
evaluated an Inflammatory Resilience Index integrating hs-CRP, serum albumin, 
and DEXA-derived appendicular lean mass. Lower IRI was significantly associated 
with fair/poor self-rated health and mobility limitations after adjustment 
for age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Adults in the lowest IRI quartile had 
approximately 2-fold higher odds of poor self-rated health and 4.5-fold 
higher odds of walking difficulty compared to the highest quartile. These 
findings support the concept that integrated assessment across inflammation, 
nutrition, and muscle mass domains may identify individuals at risk for 
functional decline.

BIOLOGICAL PLAUSIBILITY

The associations observed are biologically plausible given the well-
established interrelationships between the IRI components. Chronic low-grade 
inflammation promotes muscle catabolism through activation of the ubiquitin-
proteasome pathway and suppression of protein synthesis (7). Inflammatory 
cytokines including interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α directly impair 
myocyte function and promote sarcopenia (17). Albumin, beyond its role as a 
nutritional marker, functions as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory 
mediator; hypoalbuminemia reflects both inadequate nutritional intake and 
increased catabolism during inflammatory states (18).

The convergence of these pathways on functional outcomes is supported by 
prior literature. The Glasgow Prognostic Score (CRP + albumin) predicts 
survival in cancer patients, demonstrating the prognostic value of combining 
inflammation and nutrition (10). Sarcopenia, defined by low muscle mass 
and/or function, is associated with increased mortality, disability, and 
poor quality of life (6). Our IRI extends these concepts by integrating 
all three domains in a general adult population.

COMPARISON WITH PRIOR LITERATURE

Prior NHANES analyses have examined individual IRI components in isolation. 
Elevated hs-CRP is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality and 
all-cause mortality, even after adjustment for traditional risk factors (4). 
Low serum albumin predicts mortality across age groups and is incorporated 
into prognostic scores for heart failure and chronic kidney disease (19). 
Low appendicular lean mass, particularly when indexed to height, identifies 
individuals at risk for falls, fractures, and functional decline (20).

Our analysis extends this literature by demonstrating that a simple 
additive composite of standardized components is associated with self-
reported functional outcomes. The use of z-score transformation allows 
equal weighting of each domain and facilitates interpretation: a 1-unit 
increase in IRI represents a 1-standard-deviation improvement in overall 
resilience.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS

Although the IRI is proposed as an exploratory index rather than a validated 
clinical tool, these findings have potential implications for risk 
stratification. Routine clinical assessment already includes serum albumin 
and inflammatory markers; DEXA body composition is increasingly available. 
Integration of these measurements into a composite score could identify 
individuals who might benefit from interventions targeting inflammation 
(anti-inflammatory therapies, lifestyle modification), nutrition 
(protein supplementation, dietary counseling), or muscle mass (resistance 
exercise, physical therapy).

The strong association between IRI and self-rated health is particularly 
notable, as self-rated health is itself a powerful predictor of mortality 
and health care utilization (21). Identifying modifiable contributors to 
poor self-rated health could inform targeted interventions.

LIMITATIONS

Several limitations warrant consideration:

First, the cross-sectional design precludes causal inference. We cannot 
determine whether low IRI causes poor functional outcomes, whether 
functional limitations lead to inflammation and muscle loss, or whether 
both reflect underlying comorbid conditions. Prospective validation with 
incident outcomes is needed.

Second, the analytic sample was restricted to participants with DEXA data, 
which represents a younger and healthier subset of NHANES (mean age 39.6 
years). Results may not generalize to older or sicker populations.

Third, ALMI values were standardized to z-scores rather than using 
established sarcopenia cutoffs. This approach facilitates combination with 
other components but limits comparison with prior sarcopenia literature. 
Future analyses could evaluate IRI using clinically defined low muscle mass.

Fourth, functional outcomes were self-reported and subject to reporting 
bias. Objective measures of physical function (e.g., gait speed, grip 
strength, 6-minute walk) would strengthen causal inference.

Fifth, the IRI is proposed as an exploratory composite. Its components 
are weighted equally, and the optimal weighting scheme was not empirically 
derived. The index has not been validated in external cohorts. An 
exploratory mortality analysis is presented in the Supplemental Materials; 
however, only 20 deaths occurred, and mortality findings are severely 
underpowered and should be interpreted with caution.

================================================================================
CONCLUSIONS
================================================================================

In this nationally representative sample of U.S. adults, the Inflammatory 
Resilience Index—a simple composite of hs-CRP, serum albumin, and 
appendicular lean mass—was significantly associated with self-rated health 
and mobility limitations. Adults in the lowest IRI quartile had 2-fold 
higher odds of fair/poor health and 4.5-fold higher odds of walking 
difficulty compared to the highest quartile. These findings support IRI 
as an integrative marker of physiologic resilience capturing inflammation, 
nutrition, and muscle mass domains.

The IRI is proposed as an exploratory index warranting validation in 
prospective cohorts with hard clinical endpoints. If confirmed, the IRI 
could inform risk stratification and identify targets for intervention 
in individuals at risk for functional decline.

================================================================================
PERSPECTIVES
================================================================================

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: An Inflammatory Resilience Index combining 
hs-CRP, albumin, and appendicular lean mass identifies U.S. adults at 
elevated risk for poor self-rated health and mobility limitations.

COMPETENCY IN PATIENT CARE: Integrated assessment of inflammation, 
nutritional status, and muscle mass may help identify patients who could be 
candidates for multidimensional interventions targeting these interconnected 
domains.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Prospective validation of the IRI in diverse 
populations, with hard endpoints including mortality and incident 
disability, is needed to establish clinical utility. Research is also 
needed to determine whether interventions targeting IRI components 
improve functional outcomes.

FIGURE 1. Forest Plot of IRI Quartile Associations with Functional Outcomes
Odds ratios comparing the lowest IRI quartile (Q1) to the highest (Q4, 
reference) for three functional outcomes, adjusted for age, sex, and 
race/ethnicity. Red points indicate statistically significant associations 
(p<0.05). Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals.

FIGURE 2. Prevalence of Functional Outcomes by IRI Quartile
Bar charts showing survey-weighted prevalence (with standard error bars) 
of fair/poor self-rated health, difficulty walking ¼ mile, and depression 
(PHQ-9 ≥10) across IRI quartiles. Q1 represents lowest inflammatory 
resilience (highest inflammation, lowest albumin, lowest muscle mass) and 
Q4 represents highest resilience.

FIGURE 3. IRI Component Profiles by Quartile
Mean values of hs-CRP (mg/L), serum albumin (g/dL), and ALMI z-score across 
IRI quartiles, illustrating the distribution of each component contributing 
to the composite index.
