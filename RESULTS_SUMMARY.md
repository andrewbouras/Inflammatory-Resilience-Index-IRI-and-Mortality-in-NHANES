# Modified IRI Study: Results Summary

## Study Design
**Title:** Inflammatory Resilience Index and Mortality in U.S. Adults: NHANES 2015-2020

**Modified IRI = (-z_log_CRP) + z_Albumin + z_ALM**

Where:
- **z_log_CRP (inverted)**: Higher = less systemic inflammation
- **z_Albumin**: Higher = better nutritional status
- **z_ALM (sex-specific)**: Higher = more muscle mass (appendicular lean mass / height²)

**Higher IRI = Better inflammatory resilience**

## Key Findings

### Primary Result
**Each 1-SD increase in IRI associated with 21% lower all-cause mortality**
- HR = 0.79 (95% CI: 0.67-0.95), p = 0.0095

### IRI Quartiles vs All-Cause Mortality (Reference: Q4 = highest resilience)

| Quartile | HR (95% CI) | p-value |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Q1 (lowest) | **2.87 (1.30-6.31)** | **0.009** |
| Q2 | 1.61 (0.82-3.17) | 0.17 |
| Q3 | 1.38 (0.69-2.78) | 0.37 |
| Q4 (ref) | 1.00 | — |

**Interpretation:** Individuals in the lowest IRI quartile have nearly 3× higher all-cause mortality compared to those with the highest inflammatory resilience.

## Sample Characteristics by IRI Quartile

| Characteristic | Q1 (Lowest) | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 (Highest) |
|---------------|-------------|-----|-----|--------------|
| N | 407 | 709 | 1,132 | 2,347 |
| Age | 63.0 ± 16.4 | 64.7 ± 13.4 | 54.6 ± 17.1 | 40.1 ± 12.9 |
| Female (%) | 63.4 | 54.0 | 57.3 | 43.5 |
| BMI | 32.3 | 30.0 | 29.0 | 28.0 |
| hs-CRP (mg/L) | 5.28 | 3.19 | 2.68 | 1.68 |
| Albumin (g/dL) | 3.85 | 4.20 | 4.28 | 4.49 |
| ALMI (kg/m²) | 0.06 | 0.31 | 3.02 | 7.43 |
| Hypertension (%) | 72.2 | 72.6 | 57.9 | 38.1 |
| Diabetes (%) | 36.1 | 32.4 | 22.3 | 13.9 |
| CVD History (%) | 21.1 | 17.5 | 10.0 | 4.3 |
| Deaths | 58 | 51 | 51 | 18 |
| CV Deaths | 16 | 7 | 13 | 4 |

## Mortality by IRI Quartile

| Quartile | All-Cause Mortality (%) | CV Mortality (%) |
|----------|------------------------|------------------|
| Q1 | 14.3% | 3.9% |
| Q2 | 7.2% | 1.0% |
| Q3 | 4.5% | 1.1% |
| Q4 | 0.8% | 0.2% |

## CV Mortality

**Continuous IRI:** HR = 0.77 (95% CI: 0.55-1.09), p = 0.14

(Limited by only 40 CV deaths — underpowered for this endpoint)

---

## Cohort Summary

- **Total eligible:** 4,595
- **Cycles:** 2015-2016, 2017-2020
- **Mean follow-up:** 3.5 years
- **Deaths:** 178 (3.9%)
- **CV deaths:** 40 (0.9%)

## Technical Notes

1. **ALM substitution:** Appendicular Lean Mass (DEXA) replaces grip strength due to data availability
2. **hs-CRP exclusion:** Participants with hs-CRP >10 mg/L excluded (acute inflammation)
3. **Survey weighting:** MEC weights adjusted for pooled cycles; singleton PSU adjustment applied
4. **ALM calculation:** Sum of left/right arm and leg lean mass (excluding bone mineral content), height-adjusted

---

## Clinical Implications

1. **Integrated biomarker:** The IRI captures multiple domains of health reserve (inflammation, nutrition, muscle)
2. **Strong mortality gradient:** Nearly 18-fold difference in mortality between Q1 (14.3%) and Q4 (0.8%)
3. **Potentially modifiable:** All three IRI components are modifiable through:
   - Anti-inflammatory lifestyle/therapies
   - Nutritional optimization
   - Resistance training / physical activity
